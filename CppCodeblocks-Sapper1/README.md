<p><strong>Task</strong>:The boy Vasya really likes the famous game "Minesweeper" ("Minesweeper").
<br/ >
One person plays in the "Minesweeper". The game is played on a checkered field (hereinafter we will call it a card) N×M (N rows, M columns). There are mines in K cells of the field, in the remaining cells either a number from 1 to 8 is written — the number of mines in neighboring cells, or nothing is written if there are no mines in neighboring cells. Cells are adjacent if they have at least one common point, there cannot be more than one mine in one cell. Initially, all the cells of the field are closed. A player can open a cell in one turn. If there is a mine in the cell opened by him, he loses, otherwise the player is shown the number that stands in this cell, and the game continues. The goal of the game is to open all the cells in which there are no mines.
<br />
Vasya has this game on his computer, but it seems to him that all the cards that are in it are ugly and uninteresting. So he decided to draw his own. However, his imagination is rich, and time is short, and he wants to have time to draw as many cards as possible. Therefore, he simply selects N, M and K and places mines on the field, after which all other cells can be uniquely identified. However, he does not want to waste his precious time on determining the remaining cells. Help him!
