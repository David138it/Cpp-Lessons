# CppBuilder-Graphics1

<p><strong>Task</strong>:<br />
Two functions, sine and cosine, must be displayed on the same graph, when changing the argument of the function in the range from 0 to 10 radians. The graphs should be broken lines passing through the nodal points. The step of the nodes should be set by means of the graphical interface. It is necessary to perform a complete marking of the axes (ordinate and abscissa). Each function should use its own line style. It is necessary to organize a drawing signature of the graph.
