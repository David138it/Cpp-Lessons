# CppCodeBlocks-Keyboard1 

<p><strong>Task</strong>:<br />For this letter of the English alphabet, you need to print the letter on the right on the standard keyboard. At the same time, the keyboard is closed, i.e. to the right of the letter "p" is the letter "a", from the letter "l" is the letter "z", and from the letter "m" is the letter "q".</p>
